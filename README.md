Music Atlas is a silly correlations platform which shows various weird connections between artist or genres popularity and different country's indicators such as wealth or suicide index.

created to:
- collects data about songs (metadata + lyrics) from various open music databases.
- allows you to explore connections (song ↔ author ↔ genre ↔ country ↔ year).
- Shows strange correlations and statistics on graphs.

For example:
- Comparison of the number of k-pop concerts and the suicide rate.
- What exactly "sex playlist" means in different countries?
- Comparison of the birth rate and the popularity of new metal bands in early -00's.
- The influence of the economic system on the popularity of the "chanson" genre.
- The relationship between the number of divorces and the popularity of songs about breakups

and many more ^_^
